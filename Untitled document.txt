1. History of Linux
* 1969: UNIX was developed by AT&T Bell Labs.

* 1991: Linus Torvalds, a student from Finland, started developing a free OS kernel as a hobby.

* 1992: Linux became open-source under the GNU GPL license, combining the Linux kernel with GNU tools.

* Since then, Linux has grown into a powerful operating system used in:

   * Servers (e.g., Google, Amazon)

   * Android phones

   * Supercomputers

   * IoT devices

   * Desktops and laptops (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)











































 2. Architecture of Linux
  



🔹 Components:
      * Applications: Programs like browsers, editors, etc.

      * Shell: Interface to interact with the OS (e.g., Bash).

      * System Libraries: Provide functions for the kernel.

      * Kernel: The core part that interacts with hardware.

      * Hardware: Physical devices like CPU, disk, etc.

























 3. Linux File System Structure


  







This image shows the File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) of Linux, which defines the structure and purpose of directories in a Linux operating system. All directories originate from the root (/) directory and branch into various system and user directories.






Root Directory /
         * The top-level directory of the entire Linux filesystem.

         * Everything begins from /.

 Git Architecture






Components of Git Architecture
1. Workspace (Working Directory)
            * What it is: The directory where you modify your files — your actual project folder.

            * Commands:

               * git add <file> / mv / rm: Adds/renames/removes files and stages changes.

               * git diff: Shows differences between files in your workspace and staging area.

________________




2. Staging Area (Index)
                  * What it is: A place where Git holds changes before committing them — like a buffer.

                  * Commands:

                     * git commit: Commits staged changes to the local repository.

                     * git commit -a: Adds and commits tracked changes in one step.

                     * git reset <file>: Unstages a specific file (but doesn't delete changes).

                     * git diff --cached: Shows changes between staging area and last commit.

________________


3. Local Repository
                        * What it is: Where Git stores your committed history on your local machine.

                        * Commands:

                           * git reset <commit>: Moves the current branch to an earlier commit.

                           * git diff HEAD: Compares workspace changes to the last commit.

                           * git push: Sends your commits to a remote repository.

________________


4. Remote Repository
                              * What it is: A version of your repository hosted on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

                              * Commands:

                                 * git fetch: Fetches new data (branches, commits) from the remote, but doesn't merge.

                                 * git clone: Copies a remote repository into a new local folder.

                                 * git pull: Fetches and merges changes from the remote into your local repo.

🔁 Flow Summary
                                    1. Workspace → Staging: Use git add

                                    2. Staging → Local Repo: Use git commit

                                    3. Local Repo → Remote Repo: Use git push

                                    4. Remote Repo → Local Repo: Use git fetch or git pull

                                    5. Undo or compare: Use git diff, git reset
